## 3D Face Shield Models


This repo is intended to hold 3D models and 3D printer instructions to print face shields.

These models can be printed on most at-home 3D printers.

They were designed by a team at UCSF based on the Pursa V2 Face Shield.

These should be printed in PETG.

## Parameters

As we learn ideal printer parameters, they will be documented here.



	Infill: 20%
	Layer Height: 0.3mm
	Bed Temp: 95c


### Notes

Once the base is done, the Creality Ender-3 can run at 175% speed.

## Files

The gcode files can be put on micro SD cards and printed on 3D printers right away.

The naming convention is


	{PrinterModel}_{NumberOfCopies}_{Parnet}_C19_model{Letter}{version}.gcode


Current {Letter} is either A or C. Each is a different object. Model C is the most in demand.
